# Basic Node.js Project  

This is a simple Node.js project created as a first step into backend development. It sets up a basic Express server with multiple routes and utilizes the `dotenv` package for environment variables. The project was mainly built to explore and experiment with Node.js features.  

## Features  
- Express.js server setup  
- Environment variable handling with `dotenv`  
- Basic routes (`/`, `/twitter`, `/login`, `/youtube`)  

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Siddiqui145/node_backend
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```sh
   cd node_backend
   ```  
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```  
4. Create a `.env` file and define the port:  
   ```env
   PORT=4000
   ```  
5. Start the server:  
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```  

## Usage  
- Open `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser to see "Hello World!"  
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/twitter` to see your Twitter handle  
- Visit `http://localhost:4000/login` for a login message
